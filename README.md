An advanced agricultural suitability analysis system that integrates multiple government and environmental data sources to provide farmers with evidence-based land assessment.

## 📋 Project Timeline & Development History

This project was developed through an intensive collaborative session from **June 10-11, 2025**. The complete development conversation and decision-making process is documented in **[📄 COMPLETE CHAT TRANSCRIPT](docs/CHAT_TRANSCRIPT.txt)** - a comprehensive record of our development journey from initial API testing to production-ready deployment.

### Development Phases Completed:
1. **API Integration & Validation** - USDA NASS, EPA ATTAINS, NOAA, OpenWeather, Elevation services
2. **Water Quality Enhancement** - EPA ATTAINS integration for irrigation safety analysis
3. **System Integration Testing** - Multi-source data validation achieving 90% suitability accuracy
4. **Production Readiness** - Code cleanup, documentation, and deployment preparation
