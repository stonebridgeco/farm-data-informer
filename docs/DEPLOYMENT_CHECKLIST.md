- [x] **EPA ATTAINS** - Water quality assessments (Public API)
- [x] **NOAA Climate** - Weather data (Public stations)
- [x] **OpenWeather** - Real-time conditions (API key configured)
- [x] **Open Elevation** - Terrain analysis (Public API)
- [x] **USDA Soil Data** - Limited (CORS restrictions, needs server proxy)

### System Performance
- [x] **Test Location**: Story County, Iowa (42.0308, -93.6319)
- [x] **Agricultural Score**: 95% (211.4 bu/acre corn yield)
- [x] **Climate Score**: 88% (93.94Â°F, favorable conditions)
- [x] **Terrain Score**: 92% (281m elevation)
- [x] **Water Quality Score**: 90% (51 EPA domains)
- [x] **Overall Suitability**: 90% (Grade B)

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT READY

### Production Checklist
- [x] Environment variables configured in `.env.local`
- [x] Dependencies installed and locked (`package-lock.json`)
- [x] Build process tested (`npm run build`)
- [x] API endpoints validated and functional
- [x] Error boundaries and fallbacks implemented
- [x] Performance optimized for real-time data

### Recommended Deployment Steps

1. **Server Setup**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run preview  # Test production build
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.local` to production environment
   - Verify all API keys are functional
   - Configure CORS proxy for USDA Soil API if needed

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Monitor API usage quotas
   - Set up error tracking
   - Configure performance monitoring

4. **User Testing**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Gather farmer feedback
   - Validate suitability scores with local knowledge

## ðŸ“‹ POST-DEPLOYMENT
