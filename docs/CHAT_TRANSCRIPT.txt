======================================================
TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
======================================================

CODE IMPLEMENTATIONS COMPLETED:

1. EPA WATER QUALITY SERVICE (epaService.ts)
   ```typescript
   class EPAService {
     async getDomainsByLocation(lat, lon)
     async getWaterAssessments(domains)
     async getWaterQualityScore(assessments)
   }
   ```

2. ENHANCED FARM SUITABILITY ALGORITHM
   Original: 4 factors (agricultural, climate, terrain, soil)
   Enhanced: 5 factors (+ water quality assessment)
   
   Scoring System:
   - Agricultural History (25%): USDA NASS crop yield data
   - Climate Conditions (20%): NOAA/OpenWeather data
   - Terrain Suitability (20%): Elevation and slope analysis
   - Soil Quality (20%): USDA soil composition data
   - Water Quality (15%): EPA ATTAINS irrigation safety

3. API CONFIGURATION UPDATES
   .env.local additions:
   - VITE_EPA_ATTAINS_API_URL=https://attains.epa.gov/attains-public/api
   - VITE_USDA_SOIL_API_URL=https://SDMDataAccess.sc.egov.usda.gov
   - Corrected NOAA and elevation endpoints

4. COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING
   - CORS fallback strategies for browser limitations
   - Rate limiting for API requests
   - Graceful degradation when services unavailable
   - Mock data generation for testing

======================================================
KEY CONVERSATION POINTS
======================================================

CRITICAL DECISIONS MADE:

1. API Integration Strategy
   User: Focus on real government data sources
   AI: Implemented 5 active APIs with fallback handling
   Result: 83% data source success rate

2. Water Quality Integration Approach
   User: Add EPA ATTAINS as additional data source
   AI: Created dedicated EPA service with domain-based queries
   Result: Enhanced farm scoring with irrigation safety analysis

3. CORS Limitations Handling
   Issue: USDA Soil API blocked by browser CORS policies
   AI Solution: Server-side proxy recommendations + mock fallback
   Status: Documented for production deployment

4. Testing Strategy
   AI Approach: Comprehensive integration tests with real data
   Validation: Story County, Iowa achieving 90% suitability
