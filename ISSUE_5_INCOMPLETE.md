# Issue #5 Status: INCOMPLETE ❌

## Current Status
- ✅ Supabase project created and configured
- ✅ Environment variables set up correctly  
- ✅ Database schema file created (`database_schema.sql`)
- ✅ Database service and types created
- ❌ **SCHEMA NOT DEPLOYED** to Supabase server

## What's Missing
The `database_schema.sql` file exists locally but has **never been executed** on the Supabase server instance. The database is empty.

## Tables That Need to Be Created
```sql
❌ counties          (0/7 completed)
❌ soil_data         
❌ climate_data      
❌ water_data        
❌ terrain_data      
❌ market_data       
❌ farm_analysis     
```

## Steps to Complete Issue #5

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. **Login to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Access project: `ieemluobonofrpczoyqn.supabase.co`

2. **Execute Schema**
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy contents of `database_schema.sql`
   - Execute the SQL commands
   - Verify tables are created

### Option 2: Command Line (Alternative)
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to project  
supabase link --project-ref ieemluobonofrpczoyqn

# Apply schema
supabase db push
```

### Option 3: Programmatic Setup (Automated)
Create a setup script that executes the schema via the Supabase API.

## Verification
After setup, run:
```bash
node test-db.cjs
```

Should show:
```
✅ counties: Table exists
✅ soil_data: Table exists  
✅ climate_data: Table exists
...
📊 Schema Status: 7/7 tables exist
🎉 FULL SCHEMA EXISTS
```

## Impact on Application
Without the database schema:
- ❌ Farm data pipeline won't work
- ❌ County data cannot be stored/retrieved
- ❌ Analysis features will fail
- ❌ USDA API caching won't function

**Issue #5 must be completed before proceeding with Issues #7-15.**
